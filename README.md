# Dynamic-Road-Noise-Equalizer

## Overview
* A system that utilized the Arduino UNO microcontroller with a GPS module to automatically equalize speaker volume according to vehicle speed. 
* Enhances driving safety by eliminating the need for taking eyes off the road to manually adjust volume to compensate for road noise during driving, particularly useful for retrofitting on older vehicles with limited noise isolation. 
* The program will translate location data and map it to a specific degree that the servo motor turns for volume control. 
* Addition of a diagnostics system through an LCD and a GPS signal sensor to display real-time GPS information. 
* Custom 3D printed components to integrate equalizer system to vehicle dashboard. 

## Technologies and Parts
* Arduino UNO
* 1.3" 128x64 SPI I2C SH1106 OLED Display Module
* Neo-6M V2 GPS Module
